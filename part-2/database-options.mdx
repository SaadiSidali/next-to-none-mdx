## Database Cost Estimates for Different Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Personal Blog
- **Low Traffic**: Approximately 1000 visitors per month
- **Database Usage**: Minimal; mainly for storing blog posts and user comments
- **Compute**: Minimal; mainly for serving content and handling user interactions
- **Storage**: Around 1 GB

#### Estimated Cost:
- **Vercel Postgres**: Likely within Hobby tier, so essentially free
- **Neon**: Free tier should suffice
- **DynamoDB**: Minimal WRU and RRU, likely under $1/month
- **PlanetScale**: Free Hobby plan should suffice
- **Turso**: Starter Plan should be enough, so free

---

### Scenario 2: Medium-Sized E-commerce Site
- **Medium Traffic**: Around 50,000 visitors per month
- **Database Usage**: Moderate; inventory, user data, order history
- **Compute**: Moderate; product recommendations, inventory updates
- **Storage**: Around 10 GB

#### Estimated Cost:
- **Vercel Postgres**: Around $10 for extra compute and storage
- **Neon**: Around $5 (compute time) + $1 (extra storage) = $6
- **DynamoDB**: Approximately $5.33 (WRU and RRU)
- **PlanetScale**: Scaler Plan $29/month
- **Turso**: Scaler Plan $29/month

---

### Scenario 3: Large-Scale Social Media App
- **High Traffic**: Around 1 million visitors per month
- **Database Usage**: High; user profiles, posts, messages
- **Compute**: High; analytics, real-time updates
- **Storage**: Around 50 GB

#### Estimated Cost:
- **Vercel Postgres**: Around $100 (extra compute and storage)
- **Neon**: Around $50 (compute) + $7 (extra storage) = $57
- **DynamoDB**: Around $63.26 (WRU and RRU)
- **PlanetScale**: Scaler Pro Plan starts at $39 + extra costs likely around $100 = $139
- **Turso**: Custom, likely over $100
