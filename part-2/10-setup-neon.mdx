## Neon Serverless

We're going to use Neon posgres database for the project. Neon is a managed Postgres service. 

<Note>
We could setup a local Postgres database for local development, however this is out of scope for now and not really encouraged much, so all interactions with the database will be over the internet. 

The upside to this is:
* database is already in the cloud it's really easy to deploy staging to share features with anyone
* All development is done more closely mimicing the production environment, so there *should* be less surprises when deploying.

The downsides are:
* we need to be connected to the internet to develop
* if you're using a paid plan, you could incur charges from developing the app

## Create a New Project 

Setting up a neon project is kind of like setting up a fresh install of Postgres that's fully managed for you. Within a project, you can setup databases and roles, and within the database you can manage your tables and schemas. It's all Postgres, but Neon makes it easier to manage. Way easier.

<Instruction.Implementation>
* Name: whatever you want, or just leave blank
* Postgres Version: 15
* Region: The region closest to where you will deploy your app.
* Comput Size: Fixed Size 1/4
* Auto-suspend delay: 300 seconds

Once your project has been created, you'll be taken to the project dashboard page where you are given your connection details. Copy these details and keep them somewhere safe. You'll need them later.

## What Now?

You have your project setup in neon so you have a postgres database that you can play around with if you like. Feel free to connect using a Postgres client or use the **SQL Editor** in Neon's online console. 

Whenever you're ready to connect your app to the database, continue onto the next step.
