## Neon Serverless

## Create a new role

Purely so we can revoke or rotate it if needed.

Sam: check if there is a different preffered way.

<Note>
Roles created in the Neon console, CLI, or API, including the default role created with a Neon project, are granted membership in the neon_superuser role. 

If you want more fine-grained control over permissions, generate the role using SQL like you would with a normal Postgres database.
