# Neon Roles 

Setting up a neon project is kind of like setting up a fresh install of Postgres that's fully managed for you. Within a project, you can setup databases and roles, and within the database you can manage your tables and schemas. It's all Postgres, but Neon makes it easier to manage. Way easier.

Neon isn't 100% Postgres, it's build on top of Postgres. This gives us a few extra features but also comes with some [limitations](https://neon.tech/docs/reference/compatibility). That being said, when I'm talking about Neon and I use terms like `database` or `role` or `schema`, just picture a normal Postgres database.

When we create a new project in neon, it comes with a [database](https://neon.tech/docs/manage/databases) called `neondb` a [**default role**](https://neon.tech/docs/manage/roles) that owns that database.

We could create a new database with a different name, but the pre-created `neondb` is fine, so we can just leave that alone. We will, however, create some new roles. 

## Roles

Whenever we create a new database, it's not a bad idea (some would say it's best practice) to create new roles for our specific needs. For a web app, we'll generally benefit from having two distinct roles:

* [**Migration Role**](#migration-role): Responsible for running migrations and reshaping the database schema.
* [**Application Role**](#application-role): Handles all the application's CRUD operations but restricted from tinkering with the schema.

By isolating responsibilities, we gain several advantages:

* **Security**: Compromised or rotated credentials impact only a specific role, minimizing potential damage and work for us.
* **Permission Efficiency**: The application role is only endowed with the permissions it genuinely requires, making our system more secure.
* **Administrative Ease**: Keeping admin credentials under wraps simplifies managerial tasks, as we can be fairly certain that our admin role remains uncompromised.


## Running SQL Code 

To create new Postgres roles, you'll need to run SQL code. Choose one of the following options:

<SideBySide>
<Card title="Online Console">
In the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/), select your project.

In the left sidebar, there is a **SQL Editor** tab. If you click on that tab, you can run SQL statements directly in the online console. 
</Card>
<Card title="Postgres Client">
In the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/), select your project.

In the main dashboard, there is a **Connection Details** section. You can use these details to connect to your database using your favorite Postgres client like `psql` in terminal. 
</Card>
</SideBySide>

## Passwords 

Before we create these new roles, we need to be able to generate secure passwords for them. Here are some ways you can generate a secure password:

<Tabs>
  <Tab name="openssl">
    ```sh
    openssl rand -base64 16 | tr '+/' '-_' | tr -d '='
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab name="node">
    ```js
   import crypto from 'crypto'
   const password = crypto.randomBytes(16).toString('base64url')
   console.log(password);
   ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab name="browser js">
    ```js
   function generatePassword() {
      const bytes = new Uint8Array(16);
      window.crypto.getRandomValues(bytes);
      const base64 = btoa(String.fromCharCode(...bytes));
      return base64.replace('+', '-').replace('/', '_').replace(/=+$/, '');
   }

   console.log(generatePassword());
   ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab name="python">
    ```py 
   import secrets
   import urllib.parse

   password = secrets.token_urlsafe(16)
   encoded_password = urllib.parse.quote_plus(password)
   print(encoded_password)
   ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Or just click this button to generate a password:

This button also changes the passwords in the following SQL code so you can just copy and paste the code blocks.

## Migration Role

<Instruction ratio="1">
<Instruction.Action step={1}>
Run this code to generate a new role for the migrations:
</Instruction.Action>
<Instruction.Implementation>
```sql
-- Create a new role for migrations
CREATE ROLE migration_role WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'your_password_here';

-- Grant permissions on the "neondb" database
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE "neondb" TO migration_role;

-- Grant usage on the "public" schema
GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA public TO migration_role;
```
</Instruction.Implementation>
</Instruction>

Your migration role can connect to the database using the following connection string as long as you replace `<PGHOST>` with the value from the **Connection Details** section of the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/):

```
postgres://migration_role:your_password_here@<PGHOST>/neondb
```

<Instruction ratio="1">
<Instruction.Action step={2}>
Add this to your `.env.local` file as `MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL`.
</Instruction.Action>
<Instruction.Implementation>
```sh
MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL=postgres://migration_role:your_password_here@<PGHOST>/neondb
```
</Instruction.Implementation>
</Instruction>

## Application Role

<Instruction ratio="1">
<Instruction.Action step={3}>
Run this code to generate a new role for the application CRUD operations:
</Instruction.Action>
<Instruction.Implementation>
```sql
-- Create a new role for the application
CREATE ROLE app_role WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'your_password_here';

-- Grant permissions on the "neondb" database
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO app_role;
```
</Instruction.Implementation>
</Instruction>

Your application role can connect to the database using the following connection string as long as you replace `<PGHOST>` with the value from the **Connection Details** section of the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/):

```
postgres://app_role:your_password_here@<PGHOST>/neondb
```

<Instruction ratio="1">
<Instruction.Action step={4}>
Add this to your `.env.local` file as `DATABASE_URL`.
</Instruction.Action>
<Instruction.Implementation>
```sh
DATABASE_URL=postgres://app_role:your_password_here@<PGHOST>/neondb
```
</Instruction.Implementation>
</Instruction>


## URLs

<Instruction ratio="1">
<Instruction.Action step={4}>
Add `?sslmode=verify-full` to the end of the `MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL` connection string.
</Instruction.Action>
<Instruction.Implementation>
```sh
#focus(1:1)
MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL=postgres://migration_role:your_password_here@<PGHOST>/neondb?sslmode=verify-full
DATABASE_URL=postgres://app_role:your_password_here@<PGHOST>/neondb
```
</Instruction.Implementation>
</Instruction>

<Instruction>
</Instruction>

Neon requires SSL connections to it's database, so we need to add `?sslmode=verify-full` to the end of the connection string, but why only the migration URL?

Our next.js application is going to [Neon Serverless Driver](https://neon.tech/docs/serverless/serverless-driver) to connect to the database. This driver does not encrypt the postgres connection, it [tunnels unencrypted Postgres connections over secure websockets](https://neon.tech/blog/quicker-serverless-postgres). So the DATABASE_URL doesn't need to specify SSL, because the connection itself doesn't use SSL, the connection is tunneled over Secure Websockets. 

When we're performing migrations, we might connect to the database from a *standard* Postgres driver like posgres.js, in that case, we need the ssl flag to be set to `verify-full` so that the connection is encrypted.


## Creating a new Migration Role 

<Note>
You don't need to run any of this code right now, but it's here as a reference for *if* you need it in the future.
</Note>

If you've already performed a migration and need to create a new user to perform migrations, first delete the `migration_user`, then create a new one using the same [migration code][#migration-role] code as above. Then grant permission to the `drizzle` schema **and** transfer ownership of all tables to the new user. 

```sql 
GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA public TO migration_user2;

DO $$ 
DECLARE 
   table_name text;
BEGIN 
   FOR table_name IN (SELECT tablename FROM pg_catalog.pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public') 
   LOOP
      EXECUTE 'ALTER TABLE ' || table_name || ' OWNER TO migration_user2;';
   END LOOP;
END $$;
```

{/* ```sql
-- Optionally, grant the role ability to create new schemas
ALTER ROLE migration_user CREATEDB;

-- Grant all privileges on all tables in the public schema
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO migration_user;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA drizzle TO migration_user;

-- To automatically grant privileges on all future tables in the public schema
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON TABLES TO migration_user;

-- Optionally, you can also grant privileges on sequences if your tables use serial or identity columns
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO migration_user;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON SEQUENCES TO migration_user;
``` */}
