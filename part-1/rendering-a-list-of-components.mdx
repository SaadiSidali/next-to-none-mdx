# Rendering a List of Components

<YouTube videoId="f640Z6QZawc" />

<SideBySide ratio="1">
    Using map like this is super common in React. You need to know how this code works and how to use it.
    ```tsx
    jokes.map(joke => (
      <Joke key={joke.id} joke={joke.joke} rating={joke.rating} />
    ))
    ```
</SideBySide>


## Arrays of Components

{/* Look at the [React Props Explained](/react-props-explained) section to see an example of the `Jokes` component. */}

<SideBySide ratio="3:5">
  <ExampleCard>
    A JSX component is a normal JavaScript value, so we can store them in an array just like any other value.
  </ExampleCard>

    ```tsx
    const jokesComponents = [
      <Joke joke={"Torn jeans? Rip off"} rating={2} />,
      <Joke joke={"A Broken pencil is Pointless"} rating={3} />
    ]
    ```

</SideBySide>


<SideBySide ratio="3:5">
  <ExampleCard>
    We can render a JavaScript value inside of JSX using `{}`. An array of components is just a JS value.
  </ExampleCard>

    ```page.tsx
    const jokesComponents = [
      <Joke joke={"Torn jeans? Rip off"} rating={2} />,
      <Joke joke={"A Broken pencil is Pointless"} rating={3} />
    ]
    export default function Page() {
      return (
        <div>
          {jokesComponents}
        </div>
      )
    }
    ```

</SideBySide>


This is a really nice feature of JSX, but seems kind of pointless right now since we could have just written the `Joke` components directly in the JSX. But in a real application, this data is going to be coming from some other data source like a database. 

<SideBySide ratio="3:5">
  <ExampleCard>
    No matter where the data is coming from, it's very likely (almost guaranteed) that we'll end up with **an array of objects** that we need to render as components.

    Something like this:
  </ExampleCard>

    ```js
    const jokes = [
      {
        id: 1,
        joke: "Torn jeans? Rip off",
        rating: 2,
      },
      {
        id: 2,
        joke: "A Broken pencil is Pointless",
        rating: 3,
      }
    ]
    ```

</SideBySide>

All we need to do is take the **array of objects** and turn it into an array of components. Then we can render the components in JSX just as we did before. 

## For Loop


<SideBySide ratio="3:5">
  <ExampleCard>
    This can of course be done with a `for` loop:
  </ExampleCard>

    ```page.tsx
    const jokesComponents = []
    for (let i = 0; i < jokes.length; i++) {
      const joke = jokes[i]
      jokesComponents.push(
        <Joke joke={joke.joke} rating={joke.rating} />
      )
    }

    return (
      <div>
        {jokesComponents}
      </div>
    )
    ```

</SideBySide>


## Map

<SideBySide ratio="3:5">
  <ExampleCard>
    A much better, and much more common way of doing this is with the `map` function:
  </ExampleCard>

    ```page.tsx
    const jokesComponents = jokes.map(joke => (
      <Joke joke={joke.joke} rating={joke.rating} />
    ))

    return (
      <div>
        {jokesComponents}
      </div>
    )
    ```

</SideBySide>

## Keys

<SideBySide ratio="3:5">
  <ExampleCard>
    Make sure you **always** include a key for each component in the array. This must be unique for each component in that array, so an `id` is a good choice.
  </ExampleCard>

    ```js
    const jokesComponents = jokes.map(joke => (
      <Joke 
        key={joke.id} 
        joke={joke.joke} 
        rating={joke.rating} 
        />
    ))
    ```
